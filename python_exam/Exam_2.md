# Question 2
A car was stolen. Luckily the owner catches it and begins to chase the thief after the thief had already gone x km. After the owner traveled y km, he learned that the thief was still z km ahead. After how many more km did the owner catch up to the thief? 
Make a python code which reads from the user the x, y and z.  
Then solve the problem with python code. Make a function which writes the result in the result.txt file.

With the x=43, y=152 and z=25 the result is 211,1
